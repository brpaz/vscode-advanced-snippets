## Motivation

Snippets are a great way to be more productive and code faster. VScode built-in snippets are great, but they have some limitions, like:

- The JSON snippet format is hard to manage.
- There is not an interface to see all your snippets at a glance and create new ones.
- The "context" is limited. You can only specify spippets by language and not by file path for example. I don¬¥t want to see `dependabot.yml` snippets, if I am not in a `dependabot.yml` file.

This extensions aims to improve these issues.

## Demo

## Features

- Manage snippets directly from the VSCode interface using the Explorer.
- Configure advanced conditions to trigger the snippets (Ex: File pattern, NPM Package, etc).
- Snippets are stored in a yaml file, by snippet, in a format similar to a Kubernetes CRD, making it a lot easier to read and edit, that the original VSCode snippets format.

Here is an example of a snippet file:

```yaml
apiVersion: snippets.brunopaz.dev/v1
kind: Sniipet
metadata:
    name: my-snippet
spec:
    body: |
        console.log("Hello world")
    conditions:
        language: javascript
        file_patterns:
            - "**/**/myfile.js"
        packages:
            - format: npm
            - name: react
```
