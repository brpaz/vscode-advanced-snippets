## Demo

## Features

- Manage snippets directly from the VSCode interface using the Explorer.
- Configure advanced conditions to trigger the snippets (Ex: File pattern, NPM Package, etc).
- Snippets are stored in a yaml file, by snippet, in a format similar to a Kubernetes CRD, making it a lot easier to read and edit, that the original VSCode snippets format.

Here is an example of a snippet file:

```yaml
apiVersion: snippets.brunopaz.dev/v1
kind: Sniipet
metadata:
    name: my-snippet
spec:
    body: |
        console.log("Hello world")
    conditions:
        language: javascript
        file_patterns:
            - "**/**/myfile.js"
        packages:
            - format: npm
            - name: react
```
